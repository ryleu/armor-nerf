# Minecraft Armor Nerf

Tired of protection being too powerful? Fed up with the slap fights, waiting for the other player's four sets of gear to
degrade? Well, wait no more!

This mod will nerf armor down from a maximum of 80% damage blocked to 60% damage blocked. When combined with the new
Protection equation, `2 * level`% instead of `4 * level`%, Protection IV diamond armor becomes like pre-nerf unenchanted
diamond armor.

# Purpose

I'm running a server with a [custom factions modpack](https://github.com/ryleu/factions-pack), and my players complained
about PvP being uninteresting. My solution was to entirely change the meta by making strategy more important than raw
skill.
