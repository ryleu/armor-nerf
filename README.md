# Armor Nerf

Tired of armor being too powerful? Fed up with the slap fights, waiting for the other player's 4 sets of armor to break? Well wait no more!

This mod will nerf armor down from a maximum of 80% damage blocked to 60% damage blocked. When combined with the new Protection equation, `2 * level`% instead of `4 * level`%, this makes Protection IV diamond armor like pre-nerf unenchanted diamond armor.

# Purpose

I'm running a server with a [custom factions modpack](https://github.com/ryleu/factions-pack), and my players complained about PvP being too boring. My solution was to entirely change the meta by making strategy way more important than raw skill.
